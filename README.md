## Repo containing scripts for practicing and learning the Octave language

This repository holds scripts that were used in understanding Octave as part of the Coursera Machine Learnin course given by Andrew Ng. These are simply test functions I have written as well as some workspace images with images I have pushed. I use this repo to test new functions or capabilities of Octave.
